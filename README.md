# Scripts for [On Mechanisms, Ethical Considerations and Developmental Trajectories in Machine Learning]

This repository contains the scripts used for visualisations and demonstration in the BLL "[On Mechanisms, Ethical Considerations and Developmental Trajectories in Machine Learning]" by [Aaron Schneberger and Linus Linhof].

## Description

These scripts demonstrate the implementation of a simple neural network, create visualisations and generate graphs for our study on [Machine Learning and its Implications]."

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- keras.datasets and keras.utils

## File Description

Briefly describe the purpose of each script or directory in your repository. For example:
- `nn.py`: Implements a simple Neural Network to recognize handwritten digits
- `learning_rate_demonstration.py`: Performs a benchmark for a wide range of learning rates to visualize their impact on the efficiency of the algorithm
- `plot_activation_functions.py`: Generates figures for the activation functions used in the BLL
- `work_progress.py`: Creates the cumulative graph for our work progress seen in the chapter "Description of work progress"
