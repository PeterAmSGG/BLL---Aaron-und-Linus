# Machine Learning Mechanisms, Ethics, and Trajectories

This repository contains scripts for visualizations and demonstrations used in the BLL (Besondere Lernleistung) titled "On Mechanisms, Ethical Considerations and Developmental Trajectories in Machine Learning" by Aaron Schneberger and Linus Linhof.

## Overview

Our project explores the intricacies of Machine Learning, focusing on its mechanisms, ethical implications, and future developmental paths. The scripts in this repository implement a simple neural network and generate various visualizations to support our study.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Keras (keras.datasets and keras.utils)

## Scripts

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `nn.py` | Implements a simple Neural Network for handwritten digit recognition |
| `learning_rate_demonstration.py` | Benchmarks various learning rates to visualize their impact on algorithm efficiency |
| `plot_activation_functions.py` | Generates figures of activation functions discussed in the BLL |
| `work_progress.py` | Creates a cumulative graph of our work progress for the "Description of work progress" chapter |
